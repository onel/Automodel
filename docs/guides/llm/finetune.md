# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with NeMo Automodel

## Introduction

As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful, adapting them to
specific tasks through fine-tuning has become essential for achieving
high accuracy and relevance. There are two ways to do so 
  (1)Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) that applies full-parameter update to the pretrained model. It is useful for tasks that requires high precision although it requires more computational resources.
  (2) PEFT, specifically [Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) that updates only a small subset of parameters
while keeping the base model weights frozen. It is lightweight and reduces the
number of trainable parameters, often to less than 1%, while
achieving decent accuracy. 

NeMo Automodel simplifies the fine-tuning process by offering seamless
integration with Hugging Face Transformers. It allows you to fine-tune
models without converting checkpoints, ensuring full compatibility with
the Hugging Face ecosystem.

This guide walks you through the end-to-end process of fine-tuning
models from the Hugging Face Hub using NeMo Automodel. You'll learn how
to prepare datasets, train models, generate text with fine-tuned
checkpoints, evaluate performance using the LM Eval Harness, share your
models on the Hugging Face Model Hub, and deploy them efficiently with
vLLM.

<!-- In addition to this user guide, you can also explore our Quickstart,
which features a [standalone python3
recipe](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/nemo_automodel/recipes/llm/train_ft.py),
offering hands-on demonstrations for quickly getting started with NeMo Automodel. -->

### Model and Dataset Context
In this guide, we will fine-tune Meta’s `LLaMA 3.2 1B` model on the popular [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (Stanford Question Answering Dataset).

#### 🔍 About LLaMA 3.2 1B
**LLaMA** is a family of decoder-only transformer models developed by Meta. The **LLaMA 3.2 1B** variant is a compact, lightweight model ideal for research and edge deployment. Despite its size, it maintains architectural features consistent with its larger siblings:

- **Decoder-only architecture**: Follows a GPT-style, autoregressive design—optimized for generation tasks.

- **Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE)**: Efficient and extendable positional encoding technique.

- **Grouped-query attention (GQA)**: Enhances scalability by decoupling key/value heads from query heads.

- **SwiGLU activation**: A variant of the GLU activation, offering improved convergence and expressiveness.

- **Multi-layer residual connections**: Enhances training stability and depth scaling.

These design choices make LLaMA models highly competitive across various benchmarks, and their open weights make them a strong base for task-specific fine-tuning.

:::{tip}
In this guide, `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B` is used only as a placeholder
model ID. You can replace it with any valid Hugging Face model ID, such
as `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B`, or any other checkpoint you have access to on
the Hugging Face Hub that is supported as per [model coverage](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/docs/model-coverage/llm.md) list.
:::

:::{important}
Some Hugging Face model repositories are **gated**, you must explicitly request permission before you can download their files. If the model page shows a "Request access" or "Agree and access" button:

1.  Log in with your Hugging Face account.
2.  Click the button and accept the license terms.
3.  Wait for approval (usually instant; occasionally manual).
4.  Ensure the token you pass to your script (via `huggingface-cli login` or the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable) belongs to the account that was approved.

 Trying to pull a gated model without an authorized token will trigger a 403 "permission denied" error.

#### 📚 About SQuAD
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a **reading comprehension dataset**, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.

There are two major versions:

- **SQuAD v1.1**: All answers are guaranteed to be present in the context.

- **SQuAD v2.0**: Introduces unanswerable questions, adding complexity and realism.

In this tutorial, we’ll focus on **SQuAD v1.1**, which is more suitable for straightforward supervised fine-tuning without requiring additional handling of null answers.

Here’s a glimpse of what the data looks like:
``` json
{

    "id": "5733be284776f41900661182",
    "title": "University_of_Notre_Dame",
    "context": "Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building's gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend Venite Ad Me Omnes. Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.",
    "question": "To whom did the Virgin Mary allegedly appear in 1858 in Lourdes France?",
    "answers": {
        "text": [
            "Saint Bernadette Soubirous"
        ],
        "answer_start": [
            515
        ]
    }
}
```
This structure is ideal for training models in context-based question answering, where the model learns to answer questions based on the input context.

:::{tip}
In this guide, we use the `SQuAD v1.1` dataset, but you can use your own data.

To do so, edit the YAML `dataset` / `validation_dataset` sections (for example `dataset._target_`, `dataset_name`/`path_or_dataset`, and `split`). See [Integrate Your Own Text Dataset](dataset.md) and [Dataset Overview](../dataset-overview.md).

## Use a Recipe to Fine-Tune the Model

This example demonstrates how to fine-tune a large language model using NVIDIA's NeMo Automodel library.
Specifically, we use the LLM [train-finetune recipe](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/nemo_automodel/recipes/llm/train_ft.py), and in particular, the `TrainFinetuneRecipeForNextTokenPrediction` class to orchestrate the fine-tuning process end-to-end: model loading, dataset preparation, optimizer setup, distributed training, checkpointing, and logging.

### What is a Recipe?

A recipe in NeMo Automodel is a **self-contained orchestration module** that wires together all
components needed to perform a specific task (e.g., fine-tuning for next-token prediction or instruction tuning).
Think of it as the equivalent of a Trainer class, but highly modular, stateful, and reproducible.

The `TrainFinetuneRecipeForNextTokenPrediction` class is one such recipe. It inherits from `BaseRecipe` and implements:

- `setup()`: builds all training components from the config

- `run_train_validation_loop()`: executes training + validation steps

- Misc: Checkpoint handling, logging, and RNG setup.

:::{note}
The recipe ensures stateless, config-driven orchestration where core components like the model, dataset, and optimizer are configured dynamically using Hydra-style `instantiate()` calls, avoiding hardcoded dependencies.
:::

```

:::{tip}
To avoid using unnecessary storage space and enable faster sharing, the
adapter checkpoint only contains the adapter weights. As a result, when
running inference, the adapter and base model weights need to match
those used for training.

## QLoRA: Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation

### Introduction to QLoRA

[QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) is an PEFT technique that combines the benefits of LoRA with 4-bit quantization.

The key innovation of QLoRA is the use of **4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)** quantization, which is specifically designed for normally distributed weights commonly found in neural networks. This quantization technique, combined with double quantization and paged optimizers, dramatically reduces memory usage without significantly impacting model quality.

### Key Benefits of QLoRA

- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by up to 75% compared to full-precision fine-tuning
- **Hardware Accessibility**: Enables fine-tuning of large models on consumer-grade GPUs
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintains model quality comparable to full-precision LoRA

### QLoRA Configuration

To use QLoRA with NeMo Automodel, you need to configure both the quantization settings and the PEFT parameters. Here's an example:

``` yaml
# QLoRA configuration for Llama-3.1-8B on SQuAD dataset
# Uses 4-bit quantization with LoRA adapters

model:
  _target_: nemo_automodel.NeMoAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained
  pretrained_model_name_or_path: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B

# PEFT configuration
peft:
  _target_: nemo_automodel.components._peft.lora.PeftConfig
  match_all_linear: true  # Apply LoRA to all linear layers
  dim: 16                 # LoRA rank - can be adjusted based on model size
  alpha: 32               # LoRA alpha scaling factor
  dropout: 0.1            # LoRA dropout rate

# Quantization configuration 
quantization:
  load_in_4bit: True                        # Enable 4-bit quantization
  load_in_8bit: False                       # Disable 8-bit (use 4-bit instead)
  bnb_4bit_compute_dtype: bfloat16          # Computation dtype (bfloat16 or float16)
  bnb_4bit_use_double_quant: True           # Enable double quantization
  bnb_4bit_quant_type: nf4                  # Quantization type (nf4 or fp4)
  bnb_4bit_quant_storage: bfloat16          # Storage dtype for quantized weights
```

## Loading Large Models
The common model loading pipeline when doing distributed training is that each GPU will load the full model onto it and then hold the shard it needs. However, this is an issue when we want to train models that are larger than the memory of a single GPU. For example, a 70B parameter model takes up 140GB for the model parameters assuming BF16 data type (2 bytes per parameter). Most popular GPUs have a limit of 80GB, which means we cannot directly load the full model onto the GPU.

In these scenarios, you can pass `is_meta_device: true` in the model config. The model will then be instantiated using [PyTorch's Meta device](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/meta.html) which loads no data, but stores all other parameter metadata necessary for sharding the model. Once the model is sharded, the model weights will be populated by only loading the weights required by the respective model shard.

## Run the Fine-Tune Recipe
Assuming the above `yaml` is saved in a file named `sft_guide.yaml` (or `peft_guide.yaml` if you want to do PEFT), you can run the fine-tuning workflow either using the Automodel CLI or by directly invoking the recipe Python script.

### Automodel CLI

When NeMo Automodel is installed on your system, it includes the `automodel` CLI program that you
can use to run jobs, locally or on distributed environments.

<!-- You can use PEFT recipes via the NeMo-Run CLI (See [NeMo-Run\'s
docs](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run) for more details). LoRA are
registered as factory classes, so you can specify `peft=<lora/none>`
directly in the terminal. This provides a quick and easy way to launch
training jobs when you do not need to override any configuration from
the default recipes. -->

``` bash
automodel finetune llm -c sft_guide.yaml
```

where `finetune` is name the name of the recipe file (excluding the `.py` extension) and `llm` the domain of the model.

### Invoke the Recipe Script Directly

Alternatively, you can run the recipe [script](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/blob/main/nemo_automodel/recipes/llm/train_ft.py) directly using [torchrun](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html), as shown below.

``` bash
torchrun --nproc-per-node=8 examples/llm_finetune/finetune.py --config sft_guide.yaml
```

### Sample Output
Running the recipe using either the `automodel` app or by directly invoking the recipe script should produce
the following log:
```
$ automodel finetune llm -c sft_guide.yaml
INFO:root:Domain:  llm
INFO:root:Command: finetune

INFO:root:[val] step 20 | epoch 0 | loss 0.2469
```
For each training batch, the fine-tuning recipe logs the current loss, along with current peak memory usage and tokens per second (TPS).

In addition, the model checkpoint is saved under the `checkpoints/` directory. 
For SFT, it will have the following contents:
``` bash
$ tree checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/
checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/
├── config.yaml
├── dataloader.pt
├── model

4 directories, 11 files
```
For PEFT, it will have the following contents:
``` bash
$ tree checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/

```

## Run Inference with the NeMo Automodel Fine-Tuned Checkpoint

Inference on the fine-tuned checkpoint or PEFT adapters is supported through the Hugging Face generate API. To use it, replace the path of the full model with the path to a SFT or PEFT checkpoint, which should include all necessary configuration settings such as model type, adapter type, and base model checkpoint path.

The following is an example script using Hugging Face's Transformers library:

``` python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PeftModel #for PEFT

#For SFT, Load finetuned checkpoint
finetuned_ckpt_path = "checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/model/consolidated"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(finetuned_ckpt_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(finetuned_ckpt_path)

# For PEFT, Load base model, tokenizer and PEFT adapter
base_model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(base_model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model_name)
adapter_path = "checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/model/"
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, adapter_path)

# Move model to GPU if available
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model.to(device)

# Generate text
input_text = "Your input prompt here"
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)

# Decode and print the output
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Publish the SFT Checkpoint or PEFT Adapters to the Hugging Face Hub

After fine-tuning a Hugging Face model using NeMo AutoModel, the
resulting checkpoints or PEFT adapters are stored in a Hugging Face-native format, making
it easy to share and deploy. To make these checkpoints and adapters publicly
accessible, we can upload them to the Hugging Face Model Hub, allowing
seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

Using the Hugging Face Hub API, we can push the fine-tuned checkpoint or PEFT adapter to
a repository, ensuring that others can easily load and use it with
transformer's [AutoModelForCausalLM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM) for fine-tuned checkpoint, and
[peft.AutoPeftModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/package_reference/auto_class#peft.AutoPeftModel) for PEFT adapters.
The following steps outline how to publish the fine-tuned checkpoint or PEFT adapter:

1.  Install the Hugging Face Hub library (if not already installed):

``` bash
pip3 install huggingface_hub
```

2.  Log in to Hugging Face using your authentication token:

``` bash
huggingface-cli login
```

3.  Upload the fine-tuned checkpoint using the
    [huggingface_hub](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub) Python API:

``` python
from huggingface_hub import HfApi

api = HfApi()
api.upload_folder(
    folder_path="checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/model/consolidated",
    repo_id="your-username/llama3.2_1b-finetuned-name" or "your-username/peft-adapter-name",
    repo_type="model"
)
```

Once uploaded, the fine-tuned checkpoint can be loaded directly using:

``` python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-username/llama3.2_1b-finetuned-name")
```
Similarly, the PEFT adapter can be loaded directly using: 
``` python
from peft import PeftModel, AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("base-model")
peft_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, "your-username/peft-adapter-name")
```

By publishing the fine-tuned checkpoint or PEFT adapter to the Hugging Face Hub, we
enable easy sharing, reproducibility, and integration with downstream
applications.
<!-- 
## Evaluate with the LM Evaluation Harness

After fine-tuning the pretrained model on a domain-specific dataset
using NeMo AutoModel, the process generates one (or more) Hugging
Face-native checkpoint(s). The checkpoint(s) is/are fully compatible
with the Hugging Face ecosystem, allowing seamless integration with
evaluation tools.

To assess the performance of the fine-tuned model, we will use the [LM
Evaluation
Harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), a
standardized framework for benchmarking language models. The finetuned
checkpoint or PEFT adapters can be directly loaded into the evaluation pipeline without
additional conversion.

In the following setup, we utilize the LM Evaluation Harness to evaluate
the fine-tuned model on HellaSwag, a benchmark designed to measure
commonsense reasoning capabilities.

``` bash
ckpt="/ft_checkpoints/llama3.2_1b"
python3 -m lm_eval --model hf \
    --model_args pretrained=$ckpt \
    --tasks hellaswag \
    --device cuda:0 \
    --batch_size 8
```

This command will run lm_eval on hellaswag using the NeMo
Automodel fine-tuned checkpoint of [meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B).

Before running this command, make sure you have specified the checkpoint
path that you used during fine-tuning, we will use
[/ft_checkpoints/llama3.2_1b]{.title-ref} as in the fine-tuning section. -->

## Export to vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is an efficient inference
engine designed to optimize the deployment of large language models
(LLMs) for production use. By utilizing advanced techniques like
parallel processing and optimized memory management, vLLM accelerates
inference while maintaining model accuracy.

The following script demonstrates how to use a fine-tuned checkpoint
in vLLM, allowing seamless deployment and efficient inference:

:::{note}
Make sure vLLM is installed (pip install vllm, or use the environment that includes it).
:::


``` python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(model="checkpoints/epoch_0_step_10/model/consolidated/", model_impl="transformers")
params = SamplingParams(max_tokens=20)
outputs = llm.generate("Toronto is a city in Canada.", sampling_params=params)
print(f"Generated text: {outputs[0].outputs[0].text}")
```
```text
>>> Generated text:  It is the capital of Ontario. Toronto is a global hub for cultural tourism. The City of Toronto
```

Similarly, the following script demonstrates how to export a PEFT adapter for vLLM,
allowing seamless deployment and efficient inference.

:::{note}
Make sure vLLM is installed (pip install vllm, or use the environment
that includes it) before proceeding with vLLMHFExporter.
:::

``` python
from nemo.export.vllm_hf_exporter import vLLMHFExporter

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import argparse

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--model', required=True, type=str, help="Local path of the base model")
    parser.add_argument('--lora-model', required=True, type=str, help="Local path of the lora model")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    lora_model_name = "lora_model"

    exporter = vLLMHFExporter()
    exporter.export(model=args.model, enable_lora=True)
    exporter.add_lora_models(lora_model_name=lora_model_name, lora_model=args.lora_model)

    print("vLLM Output: ", exporter.forward(input_texts=["How are you doing?"], lora_model_name=lora_model_name))
```
